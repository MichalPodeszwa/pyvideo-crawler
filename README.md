# PyVideo Crawler

## NOTE!

This is work in progress!

## Overview

This is supposed to:

* Download all videos from pyvideo.org
* Store them in MongoDB
* Show them in a paginated table view
* Make possibility of marking them as watched or that you're uninterested about them
* After having downloaded all files from pyvideo.org, you can only download new files only, without redownloading older ones.
